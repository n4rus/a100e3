A100 & 3 is a company founded in Brazil, and as our means we use our services to manufacture technology. Starting from LEDs to houses, business and public spaces, we shall help to deliver suitable solutions for specific situations, as well to general use.
By november 2020 the company focused on developing software tools and enviroment management to offer solutions that could also improve similar opperations abroad in order to not only cover internal tasks but to help and foster clients or developers.

The software reached a complex point right after the Tbot white-paper, and because of this the focus was again changed, and now the youtube and white-void are the 
focus. After the end of the year the content shall change progressivly to resources and themes around PI, P103, the White-Void comic, and the book  
Intriguing-Surreality. From games, drawings, and texts of fiction, to real tests and experiments around objective matters. LEDs, Cryptocurrencies, and electric 
energy, are the foundation, having the guides of modern physics(quantum/g.relat.), having eletrons and photons at it's core, as photoelectric fenomena and magnectic field mechanics. The energy transmission and generation are the main concern, besides keeping the average usage performance in sight to also improve it's ratio and 
overall perfomance in terms of energy/task. This may sound exctly how humanity evolve now, but having those as controlled variables of the experiment may lead to 
the next generation of methods, physics, and devices of the future. By doing sequenced layers of isolation, the experiment can be controled in much higher precision 
scales. This is the key method purposed in my research and content untill now, and as time goes by, the amount of work done goes up and future goals come closer. I
already dominated mathematics that where troublesome before, and now I can share toughts togheter with other scientists about matters I could not cover before. In 
time, the producs of the work shall come out.
